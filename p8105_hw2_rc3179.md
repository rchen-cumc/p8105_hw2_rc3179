## Problem 1

``` r
#Read in Mr. Trash Wheel, omitting non-data entries and rows without dumpster-specific data, then rounding sports balls to integers
trash_data = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    range = "A2:N370") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

``` r
#Read in 2017 precipitation data excluding rows without precipitation data and adding year
precip2017_data = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)

#Read in 2018 precipitation data excluding rows without precipitation data and adding year
precip2018_data = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

#Combine precipitation datasets and convert month to characters
combined_precip = 
  bind_rows(precip2017_data, precip2018_data) %>% 
  mutate(month = c(month.name,month.name))
```

The Mr. Trash Wheel database shows that there are a total of 314
observations and 314 dumpsters which collected trash between May 2014
and December 2018. In total, Mr. Trash Wheel collected 1029.97 tons of
trash with a volume of 4898 in cubic yards. The median number of sports
balls pulled from dumpsters in 2017 was 8. In terms of precipitation in
2017 and 2018 combined, there were a total of 24 observations with a
total precipitation of 32.93 in 2017 and total precipitation of 32.93 in
2018.
