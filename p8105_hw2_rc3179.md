## Problem 1

``` r
#Read in Mr. Trash Wheel, omitting non-data entries and rows without dumpster-specific data, then rounding sports balls to integers
trash_data = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    range = "A2:N370") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

``` r
#Read in 2017 precipitation data excluding rows without precipitation data and adding year
precip2017_data = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)

#Read in 2018 precipitation data excluding rows without precipitation data and adding year
precip2018_data = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

#Combine precipitation datasets and convert month to characters
combined_precip = 
  bind_rows(precip2017_data, precip2018_data) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

The Mr. Trash Wheel database shows that there are a total of 314
observations and 314 dumpsters which collected trash between May 2014
and December 2018. In total, Mr. Trash Wheel collected 1029.97 tons of
trash with a volume of 4898 in cubic yards. The median number of sports
balls pulled from dumpsters in 2017 was 8. In terms of precipitation in
2017 and 2018 combined, there were a total of 24 observations with a
total precipitation of 32.93 in 2017 and total precipitation of 32.93 in
2018.

## Problem 2

``` r
#Read in pols-month.csv and clean
pols = 
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  mutate(president = if_else(prez_gop==1, "gop", "dem")) %>% 
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
#Read in snp.csv and clean
snp = 
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  select(year, month, everything())
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
#Read in unemployment.csv and tiday to long format with same variable names/formats
unemployment = 
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "unemployment_rate") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[match(month, month.abb)]) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  arrange(year, month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
#Merge snp into pols then merge unemployment into result
pol_data = 
  full_join(pols, snp, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
  full_join(unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The pols-month dataset contained data on the number of positions
Democrats and Republicans held in Congress, as governors, or as the
President, spanning from January 1947 to June 2015. The snp dataset
contained the closing value of the S\&P index for each month, spanning
from April 1950 to May 2015. The unemployment dataset contained the
unemployment rate for each month, spanning from April 1948 to September
2015. The final dataset had dimensions of \[828 x 11\], with data
spanning from January 1947 to September 2015 and variables of year,
month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem,
president, close, unemployment\_rate.

    ethnicity = if_else(ethnicity=="ASIAN AND PACI", "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER", ethnicity),

#Table to show most popular male baby names over time
boy_names = 
  filter(baby_names, gender=="MALE", rank==1) %>%
